     * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a security model based on a combination
     * of strict user ownership and collaborative, shared access. User data is private
     * to the individual, while trip data is accessible to a defined group of participants.
     *
     * Data Structure:
     * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile data. Access is restricted to the owner.
     * - /trips/{tripId}: Shared trip documents. Access is controlled by a denormalized
     *   `participantIds` array within each document.
     * - /trips/{tripId}/messages/{messageId}: Chat messages for a trip. Access is
     *   inherited from the parent trip's participant list.
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * - User privacy is paramount; listing or viewing other users' profiles is disallowed.
     * - The `participantIds` array on a trip document is the single source of truth for
     *   authorization, making rules fast and secure without extra reads for list operations.
     * - Any signed-in user can create a trip, but they must include themselves as the
     *   first participant.
     * - Any existing participant of a trip can modify the trip details or add/remove
     *   other participants, fostering a collaborative environment.
     * - Chat messages can only be sent by trip participants, and only the original sender
     *   can edit or delete their own messages.
     *
     * Denormalization for Authorization: Access to `/trips` and their `messages` subcollections
     * is controlled by the `participantIds` array denormalized onto each `/trips/{tripId}` document.
     * This avoids impossible-to-secure queries and slow `get()` calls in list rules, enabling
     * secure and performant queries like `where('participantIds', 'array-contains', userId)`.
     *
     * Structural Segregation: The ruleset naturally separates private and shared data by using
     * distinct top-level collections (`/users` for private, `/trips` for shared), which is an
     * inherently secure and performant pattern.
